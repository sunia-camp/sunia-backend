      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>I hope this email finds you well. SUNIA is nearly here, and as such, I'd like to offer a few last reminders and requests.</p>
        <header>
        <h3>Sunday Afternoon</h3>
        <p>The bus will be departing from the <strong>Red Deer Public Library (4818 49 St, Red Deer, AB T4N 1T9)</strong> at 5:00 PM on August 7. Please make sure you're there by 4 or 4:15 to ensure sufficient time for rapid tests and boarding. Also, please be aware that we <i> do not serve dinner </i> on Sunday night, so we suggest you bring food on the bus or eat in Red Deer.
        <h3>Vaccination Records</h3>
        <p>As per my previous emails and our COVID-19 safety plan, we will be <strong>requiring proof of vaccination at the bus</strong>, by means of the Alberta-issued COVID-19 vaccine record (for students from Alberta). Please make sure you've downloaded your vaccination record from <strong><a href="https://covidrecords.alberta.ca/home">here</a></strong> before you head out to SUNIA. If you are from Alberta but do not have a Personal Health Number, please call 811 to get your record. If you are from outside of Alberta, please follow your own province's procedures for acquiring proof of vaccination and bring that to the bus.</p>
      <p>All of us on staff are looking forward to meeting you, and we hope you're excited for SUNIA 2022!</p>
      <br><p>Sincerely,
      <p><strong>Patrick Harvey</strong><br>Registrar<br>registrar@sunia.ca<br>(780) 695-6697<br><a href="https://sunia.ca">sunia.ca</a></p>
