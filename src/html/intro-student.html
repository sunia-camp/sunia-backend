      <h3>Location Update</h3>
      <p>SUNIA has unfortunately been forced to relocate from the Goldeye Centre for our 2023 program. For more information on our new location, Camp Whitney, please check out our <a href="https://www.sunia.ca/location">website</a>. Our team is working hard to adapt SUNIA to its new location, and we can assure you that this change will not jeopardize your experience in any way. Please keep an eye out for more updates from us as we finalize more details!</p>
      <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
      <p>In the case that you cannot attend SUNIA for any reason, and you wish to cancel your registration <strong>prior to July 1st 2023,</strong> we will charge a <strong>$100 cancellation fee.</strong> If you have already paid, this means we will refund you all but $100 of your payment. Cancellations received on or after July 1st <strong>will not receive a refund.</strong> In the case of extenuating circumstances (such as COVID-19 infection or outbreak), please contact me and we can discuss the possibility of a full refund, or other options.</p>
      </header>
      <p>Last thing: please do not hesitate to reach out to me at registrar@sunia.ca with any questions or concerns you may have. Our counsellors look forward to welcoming you to SUNIA this August!</p>
