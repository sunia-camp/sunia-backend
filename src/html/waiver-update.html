    <p>Dear students & parents,</p>
    <p>On behalf of SUNIA's staff and board, thank you for your continuing patience as we adjust to our new location at Camp Whitney! This move has required us to redraft our normal waivers, which are now complete.</p>
    <p>These <strong>updated versions of our waivers can be filled out and signed online at <a href="sunia.ca/waivers">sunia.ca/waivers</a></strong>, or you can get in touch with our Registrar, Patrick Harvey, at registrar@sunia.ca to request PDF copies which you can print, sign, scan, and email back to us. Whichever method you prefer, we ask that you <strong>please take the time to fill out these waivers at your earliest convenience</strong>, as they are <strong>required</strong> for you or your child to attend SUNIA.</p>
    <p>If you have already signed the previous copies of the waiver, we unfortunately must ask you to fill out the new ones regardless, as the previous version does not fully apply to our new location.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your patience and attention, and we ask that you keep an eye out for further updates in the next few weeks as we draw nearer to the dates of SUNIA. If you have any questions, please get in touch with our Registrar, Patrick Harvey, at registrar@sunia.ca and we'll be happy to help.</p>
    <p>We look forward to meeting you, or your child, at SUNIA this August!</p>
    <br>Regards,
    <p><strong>Patrick Harvey</strong><br>Registrar<br>registrar@sunia.ca<br>(780) 695-6697<br><a href="https://sunia.ca">sunia.ca</a></p>
