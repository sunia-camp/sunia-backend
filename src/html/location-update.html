    <p>Dear students & parents,</p>
    <p>Recently, SUNIA has been informed that the Goldeye Centre is pausing all operations and cancelling all bookings this year due to maintenance challenges. This will mean that <strong>we will have to relocate for this year's program.</strong></p>
    <p>Fortunately, we have secured a new facility that will allow SUNIA to run without major changes to program content. The new facility, called <strong><a href="https://www.camp-whitney.ca/">Camp Whitney</a></strong>, is located in Whitney Lakes Provincial Park near Elk Point, AB. This change in venue will, of course, require some changes to our program (such as different hiking options), but we can assure you that we will be accommodating for all changes and your experience will not be jeopardized in any way. Many of the details have not yet been finalized, so we ask for your patience as we work on adjusting SUNIA to a new location -- more information will be forthcoming as it becomes available.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to registrar@sunia.ca, or if you would prefer a phone conversation get in touch with Rian Hoyle at (780) 266-7426.</p>
    <br>Regards,
    <p>
