      <p>Hello once more!</p>
      <p>Well, the 70th SUNIA has come to an end. I, and all of us counsellors, sincerely hope you enjoyed your week with us as much as we enjoyed meeting all of you, and that you have fond memories of your time at the Goldeye Centre.</p>
      <p>On the topic of fond memories, I'm happy to say that the group photos from your week are available. Some of you may have had a chance to put your name down during SUNIA, but in case you missed out, they're also available now. If you'd like us to send you a copy and haven't yet ordered one, please e-transfer $5 (just to cover printing & mailing costs) to <strong>director@sunia.ca</strong>, including the name of the student in the message, and fill out <strong><a href="https://forms.gle/hZ69FgvQDZqti6Ah9">this form</a></strong>. Please note that we'll be sending these out on the <strong>1st of October</strong>, so if you want one, make sure you order by that date!</p>
      <p>Lastly, if you came home from SUNIA without an item that you brought with you, please keep an eye out for one last email from me with a list of lost-and-found items.</p>
      <p>Thank you all so much for bringing your brilliant minds, kind hearts, and incredible enthusiasm to SUNIA - you truly made this year an experience to remember.</p>
      <br><p>Good day to you all,
      <p><strong>Patrick Harvey</strong><br>Registrar<br>registrar@sunia.ca<br>(780) 695-6697<br><a href="https://sunia.ca">sunia.ca</a></p>
