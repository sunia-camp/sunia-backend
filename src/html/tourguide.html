    <p>Hello students & parents,</p>
    <p>I hope this email finds you well. As we draw nearer to the dates of SUNIA, staff has compiled what we call our "Tour Guide to SUNIA", containing everything you'll need to know: transportation, a packing list, a schedule, and some letters from our counsellors. You'll find the Tour Guide attached to this email; I encourage you to read through it as soon as possible, and contact me if you have any questions.</p>
    <p>We'll also be trying to get in touch with you by phone this Sunday or over the next week or so, just to make a final check of the information you've provided and answer any questions you might have, so keep an eye out for that! If you won't be able to speak on the phone for any reason, feel free to let me know by email and we won't bother you by calling.</p>
    <p>See you at SUNIA!</p>
    <br>Regards,
    <p><strong>Patrick Harvey</strong><br>Registrar<br>registrar@sunia.ca<br>(780) 695-6697<br><a href="https://sunia.ca">sunia.ca</a></p>
