      <ul>
        <li>Select a <a href="https://www.sunia.ca/payment-type" target="_blank">payment option</a>, or submit a request for a deferral or financial aid.</li>
        <li>Complete your childâ€™s waivers at <a href="sunia.ca/waivers" target="_blank">sunia.ca/waivers</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This email reminder sends weekly every Sunday. If you know you've already completed all of these items, feel free to disregard this email; I may not have had a chance to update our records yet.
