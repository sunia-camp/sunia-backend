      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>I hope this email finds you well. I'd just like to take this opportunity to give a few more details about the implementation of our COVID-19 safety policy, and to point out a few other miscellaneous things relating to COVID safety at SUNIA.</p>
        <header>
        <h3>Rapid Tests</h3>
        <p>Firstly, as outlined in our COVID-19 safety plan, we will have government-issued rapid tests at the bus. We will be <strong>requiring a negative test result from all students</strong> before they board. If any student tests positive, they will unfortunately not be permitted to attend, and a full refund will be issued.</p>
        <h3>Booster Doses</h3>
        <p>To minimize the odds that you test positive before SUNIA, we <i>strongly encourage</i> you to <strong><a href="https://bookvaccine.alberta.ca/vaccine/s/">get a booster dose</a> ASAP</strong> if you're eligible. If you're under 18 and haven't gotten your first booster, we encourage you to do so ASAP.
        <h3>Proof of Vaccination</h3>
        <p>Also, we will be <strong>requiring proof of vaccination at the bus</strong>, by means of the Alberta-issued COVID-19 vaccine record (for students from Alberta). You can access your record <strong><a href="https://covidrecords.alberta.ca/home">here</a></strong> by entering your Alberta Personal Health Number, date of birth, and month of vaccination - once you have done so, please <strong>bring it with you</strong> to the bus (or to the Goldeye Centre directly, if you're not taking the bus). If you are from Alberta but do not have a Personal Health Number, you can get your record by calling 811. If you are not from Alberta, please follow your province's procedures for acquiring proof of vaccination.</p>

      <p>All of us on staff look forward to a fun and safe SUNIA this August!</p>
      <br><p>Sincerely,
      <p><strong>Patrick Harvey</strong><br>Registrar<br>registrar@sunia.ca<br>(780) 695-6697<br><a href="https://sunia.ca">sunia.ca</a></p>
