      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>Thank you for completing your SUNIA registration form. Here are the remaining steps you need to take to guarantee your spot at SUNIA:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete our <a href="https://www.sunia.ca/registrant-info" target="_blank">student information form.</a></li>
        <li>Select a <a href="https://www.sunia.ca/payment-select" target="_blank">payment option</a>, or submit a request for a deferral or financial aid.</li>
        <li>Complete our updated waivers at <a href="sunia.ca/waivers" target="_blank">sunia.ca/waivers</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to these necessary items, we currently have a large number of students registered for Week A (August 13-18), to the extent that we have had to implement a waiting list for new registrants. If you are currently registered for Week A, and would be willing to switch to Week B either alone or alongside any friends with whom you may be attending SUNIA, we'd greatly appreciate it! This helps us make sure that as many students as possible can attend SUNIA this year. Thanks so much!</p>
      <p>This email reminder sends weekly every Sunday. If you know you've already completed all of these items, feel free to disregard this email; I may not have had a chance to update our records yet. Should you receive it erroneously for 2 weeks in a row, please reply to this email right away.</p>
      <br><p>Sincerely,
      <p><strong>Patrick Harvey</strong><br>Registrar<br>registrar@sunia.ca<br>(780) 695-6697<br><a href="https://sunia.ca">sunia.ca</a></p>
