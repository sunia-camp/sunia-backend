    <p>Dear students & parents,</p>
    <p>We'd like to thank you for your patience while we continue to work on adapting the logistics of SUNIA to our new home at Camp Whitney. While many aspects of this process are still ongoing, we do have updates on the topic of <strong>transportation.</strong></p>
    <p>Due to the change in location, we have been forced to conclude that it is no longer practical for our buses to depart from Red Deer. Instead, <strong>buses this year will depart from Edmonton</strong> - specifically from <strong>McKee Playground, at 10725 51 Ave NW.</strong></p>
    <p>We realize that this does make transportation more difficult for some of our students (particularly those residing in Calgary). Having discussed the issue among our staff and board, we've developed alternatives that we hope will alleviate or compensate for this inconvenience. If the change of drop-off point from Red Deer to Edmonton does negatively affect you, please reply to this email or contact our Registrar, Patrick Harvey (see contact information below) to discuss how we can best accommodate you.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your patience and attention, and we ask that you keep an eye out for further updates in the next few months as we finalize more of the logistical elements of our move. If you have any questions, please get in touch with our Registrar, Patrick Harvey, at registrar@sunia.ca or call (780) 695-6697, and we'll be happy to help.</p>
    <p>We look forward to meeting you, or your child, at SUNIA this August!</p>
    <br>Regards,
    <p><strong>Patrick Harvey</strong><br>Registrar<br>registrar@sunia.ca<br>(780) 695-6697<br><a href="https://sunia.ca">sunia.ca</a></p>
