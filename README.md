# sunia-backend
 SUNIA's backend. Using Google Apps Script and CLASP.

##  running on your machine

### requirements

- node, npm
- an internet connection

### setup

1. Run `npm install -g @google/clasp` to install clasp, Google's command line utility for working with apps script projects. In short, it slaps.
2. Use Chrome and add `registrar@sunia.ca` as an account. (We should have an IT/CTO account, but right now it's just an alias. Michael will talk to Andrew about this!)
3. Visit [this link](https://script.google.com/home/usersettings) and make sure the Google Apps Script API is turned on.
4. Run `clasp login` and `clasp create/clone` to get started. See the [documentation](https://github.com/google/clasp) for more information. (Of course when you run login, login to the registrar email!)
